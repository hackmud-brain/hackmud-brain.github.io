WizMUD is an ongoing event in hackmud. It was released on May 1st, 2024. It has not yet been concluded.

## Plot Summary

Wizards and goblins have invaded hackmud en-masse, swiftly setting up infrastructure and establishing themselves as a major presnce.
The scripts which they create and use have magical names. Notable examples are (( wiz.magic_missile )) and (( wiz.spellbound )).
In a matter of hours they established a corporation within the mud and elevated themselves into the top ten rankings.

Originally the magic missile could be accessed via the user mordenkainen at (( mordenkainen.magic_missile )) and a cost would be taken for its use.
This concept eventually grew into attempting to create a unique currency distinct from (( GC )) called (( WC )) (WizCoin), complete with a nearly complete emulation of many functions present in ((trust.scripts)), cosmetics and an advancement system.
Thus, WizMUD was born. Eventually, all scripts relating to WizMUD were moved to the users wiz and wiztrust.

A short time after this, work began on something truly ambitious. The user tower_corp was created, emulating the look, feel, and mechanics of official public corp scripts.

(( tower_corp.public )) has yet to be released to the public.

## Gameplay

Using the (( wiz.mud )) script you are able to purchase (( WC )) in exchange for (( GC )).
This currency is used to cast 'spells', scripts such as ((wiz.magic_missile)), as well as initiate yourself as a wizard. This earns you hat, a title, and prestiege among the magical community.
By obtaining more (( WC )) be it through direct purchase or via trades among other members of the community, you can further your rank within ((wiz.mud)) for even fancier hats and titles.
Collaboration among the wizard community is highly encouraged.
